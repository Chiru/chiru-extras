Dataset Format: ASCII
Number of Contexts:3 
Type of Context: Activity
Sensors used: Accelerometers, Air pressure Sensor, Gyroscopes, Force Sensitive Resistors
Classes: Level Walking, AScending Stairs, Descending Stairs

Created by: Holger Junker
The data set contains readings  from different sensors attached to the body of a test subject who was walking a
 predefined path in a building including level walking, ascending and descending stairs
The sampling rates of all sensors were set to 100Hz except for the sampling rate of the air pressure sensor (1Hz)
